# MADHAV ECOMMERCE SALES DASHBOARD

## Project Overview

The **MADHAV ECOMMERCE SALES DASHBOARD** is an interactive and visually appealing Power BI project. It provides a comprehensive analysis of an e-commerce business's sales data. This dashboard was created to uncover key insights, such as sales distribution, profit trends, customer spending, and payment mode preferences, while allowing users to filter and interact with the data.

This project demonstrates my ability to work with business data, clean and analyze datasets, and present insights using interactive visualizations. Itâ€™s a step toward showcasing the potential of Power BI in enabling data-driven decisions.
